##Thoughtworks Tech Assignment

As part of the ThoughtWorks application process, I have been asked to complete the 'Mars Rover' kata. In building the Mars Rover app, I intend to demonstrate my current development ability. In particular I'd like to showcase my knowledge of areas such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design principals of OOP such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), encapsulation and dependency management, and design patterns, which can be used to improve adherence with these principals.
